## Lesson8 

### 1982 Savings Account

term: the minimum period you have to put in, cannot get it out without a penalty

### Federal Funds and Interest Rates

`overnight rate`: 콜금리, overnight market에서 자금을 빌리고 빌려주는 대가로 사용하는 금리

Federal Funds Rate: currently 0%

EONIA: European Over Night Index Average: trending down 

It's costly to store cash, because you need vaults, insurance, trucks, guards, etc. So the interest rate can become negative. 

Interest rate tends to be small numbers like 3% or 5% because of technical progress, time preferences and advantages to roundaboutness 



### Compound Interest (복리)

earn interest of interests every year. 



### Discount Bonds

bond that carries no coupon 

you buy at discounted price

presented discounted value



### Consol and Annuity

consol: type of a bond. doesn't expire (영구채권 - 영국에서...)

annuity: 연금



### Forward Rates and Expectation Theory

forward rate: 선도금리

expectation theory: 기대 이론



### Inflation

indexed bonds



### Leverage

put more money into an asset than you can

 in deflation, it's better to not get loans. deflation -> 화폐가치 상승



## Lesson9

### Market Capitalization by Country

market capitalization(시가 총액) = price per share * number of shares

US stock market is not America.

미국주식에 미치다 TV 

- S&P 500 투자하면, 대부분 다국적 기업이기 때문에, 자동적으로 다른 나라에 투자가 된다
- 자동적으로 risk 관리가 된다 
- USD 달러로, 다른 외국 currency에 투자가 될수도 있다
- 메르까도리브레 아르헨티나 기업 (미국 상장 기업) 

liability = debt

add everything that house hold has = stock, household, fund, etc.. 

and subtract it with debt -> household net worth

most part of money is locked up on housings?



### The Corporation

what is a stock? 

corporation = a body, artificial person

1 share = 1 vote in corporate decision making

NPO = do not distribute their profits to the shareholders

FPO = shareholders take the money

NPO should be defined with a purpose which will motivate the use of the profits



### Shares and Dividends

when you get shares, you have to think in a relative perspective, how many do I have compared to the total?

number of shares can be split 

berkshire hathaway is famous for not splitting stocks

capital gains + dividends = reason for buying stocks

after they distribute dividends, the stock price goes down 



### Common vs. Preferred

commons stock(보통주): cannot receive dividends until preferred stock dividends have been paid up

preferred stock(우선주): has a specified dividend which doesn't grow through time, but doesn't have voting right



### Corporate Charter (기업 헌장, 정관, 법인 세울 때 필요한 것, 회사 규칙)

every share gets same dividends if board decided to pay

different classes of shares have different amount of voting rights

### Corporations Raise Money

1. save money and retain earning
2. borrow money, issue debt,
3. issue shares (dilution) -> 대한항공



### Dilution

if you get dividends as stock, you've gotten diluted



### Share Repurchase

company buys back it's own shares

reverse of dilution 

alternative way of paying dividends 

it allows you(company) to postpone capital taxes?



### PDV of Expected Dividends

price earning ratio

price dividend ratio

price of a share = PDV of it's expected future dividends

Securities Analysis



### Why do firms pay dividends?

self control theory of dividends - 뭐더라.. 

- principal: 원금

Signaling theory - proves that I'm good

Lintner Model of Dividends
