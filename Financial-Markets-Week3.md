## Lesson8 

### 1982 Savings Account

term: the minimum period you have to put in, cannot get it out without a penalty

### Federal Funds and Interest Rates

`overnight rate`: 콜금리, overnight market에서 자금을 빌리고 빌려주는 대가로 사용하는 금리

Federal Funds Rate: currently 0%

EONIA: European Over Night Index Average: trending down 

It's costly to store cash, because you need vaults, insurance, trucks, guards, etc. So the interest rate can become negative. 

Interest rate tends to be small numbers like 3% or 5% because of technical progress, time preferences and advantages to roundaboutness 



### Compound Interest (복리)

earn interest of interests every year. 



### Discount Bonds

bond that carries no coupon 

you buy at discounted price

presented discounted value



### Consol and Annuity

consol: type of a bond. doesn't expire

annuity: 연금



### Forward Rates and Expectation Theory

forward rate: 선도금리

expectation theory: 기대 이론



### Inflation

indexed bonds



### Leverage

 in deflation, it's better to not get loans. deflation -> 화폐가치 상승
