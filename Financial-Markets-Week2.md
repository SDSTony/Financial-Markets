# Financial Markets Week2

This is a review on Week2 course of Financial Markets on Coursera. 

## Lesson5 

what are take aways in this lesson?

innovations in finance market

1. limited liability - you don't have to be accused for the mistakes of the company, only be responsible for the money you've invested in 
2. inflation indexed debt

### Invention Takes Time

a lot of resistance when inventing wheels with suitcases 



### Salon - Innovation

people savor the small probability with good outcomes

reframe risks so they are appealing 



### Limited Liability (financial obligations)

investors, in order to be encouraged to invest in businesses, should have protection against liability for what the managers of the business do

example: if you want to invest in trading, you shouldn't have to pay for the loss when the ship sinks

investor of the stocks doesn't have to be pursued for the mistakes of the company

if you are responsible for everything you do, you won't invest money -> it's like lottery ticket

human factors engineering 



### Inflation Indexed Debt

the problem of paying debt in currencies is that currencies are instable 

tie a contract to an index, indexing the value of debt to an index



### Unidad de Fomento

unit of development (unit of account)

money functions

- a store of value
- a unit of account
- a medium of transaction

UF is tied to consumer price index



### Real Estate: Risk Management Devices

people aren't protected against the fluctuations of real estate prices 

short the house market to insure yourself





## Lesson6

### Forecasting

random walk model in finance: 
$$
x_{t} = x_{t-1} + \epsilon
$$
first order autoregressive model
$$
x_{t} = 100 + p(x_{t-1} - 100) + \epsilon 
$$
where (-1 < p < 1), 100 is the 기준점

human psychology is not easily managed

advocates of efficiency market hypothesis should predict a constant line or an exponentially growing line because they assume market is unpredictable 



### Intuition of Efficiency

something you read in news is already incorporated in the stock price

efficient market hypothesis: security prices accurately reflect the available information, and respond rapidly to new information as soon as it becomes available. 

efficient market hypothesis has taken hit after financial crisis

**Much more research is needed before we have a full understanding of why asset prices sometimes get so out of line with what appears to be their discounted future payoffs**

three forms of market effiency: Harry Roberts

- weak form efficiency: prices incorporate information about past prices
- semi strong form: incorporate all publicly available information 
- strong form: all information, including inside information 



### Price as PDV

price of a stock should be the present discounted value (pdv) of expected dividends 



### Doubting Efficiency

efficient market theory is half true 

stock market has tendency to fall before recession

or the market causes the recession 



## Lesson7

People either exaggerate it, or ignore it 



### Chalk Talk - More on Prospect Theory

Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky

we feel more unhappiness on losing



### Logical Fallacies

wishful thinking bias: people overestimate the probability on things they want to see happen

overconfidence

cognitive dissonance: mental conflict that occurs when one learns one's beliefs are wrong, avoidance behavior



### The Brain

Mental Comparments: people don't look at the whole portfolio like it's stated in CAPM

Attention Anomalies: can't pay attention to everything due to capacity limit 

- social basis for attention: people pay attention to what other people are looking at
- some stocks will become underpriced because they will be forgotten from most of people's attention

Anchoring: refers to the tendency in ambiguous situations to allow one's decisions to be affected by some anchor 

- stock prices are anchored to past values

Representativeness heuristic: judge by similarity to familiar types 

Disjunction Effect: inability to make decisions in advance in anticipation of future information 



### Magical Thinking

magical thinking: developing superstition about certain act

Quasi magical thinking: people bet more on something that didn't happen yet



### Personality Disorders

tendency to adapt beliefs of others

antisocial personality disorder
